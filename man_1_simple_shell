.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a basic imitation of a command line interpreter that reads and implements basic commands from user input, much like a regular shell would.
.PP
.B hsh
is compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with gcc 4.8.4 (C90). It is designed to run in both interactive and non-interactive modes.
.PP
.SH USER INPUT
Once a user enters a command and presses enter, the shell performs the following actions:

1. Splits the command into an array of words.

2. Searches for the command.

3. Executes the command.
.PP
.SH SEARCH FOR COMMAND
When locating a command, the shell first looks for a built-in command with that name.
If no built-in command is found, the shell searches for the command in the PATH.
.PP
.SH EXECUTE COMMAND
Commands are executed in a child process of the main process.
.PP
.SH BUILTINS
.IP env
Prints all environment variables.
.IP exit
Exits the process and frees allocated memory.
.PP
.SH BUGS
There are memory leaks when exiting the shell. This will be fixed in a later version of the shell.
